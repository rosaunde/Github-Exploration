Hey! My project is written in python. I used the requests package to acquire the JSON data and 
Matplotlib to visualise the data.

Any github user that follows at least one user with a few repositories and followers should be ideal 
users to put into the program.

The commits per year part doesn't quite work as for some reason the api only lists events from 2017, and I 
couldn't figure out a way to get it to display more. The pie chart of number of users you follow that follow 
you back works just fine as long as you have followers and are following others. Otherwise it displays nothing. 

Thanks!
